              <h4>1. What is data?</h4>
              <p class="lead">Data are the raw facts and figure. For example name of a person, place can be a data. Price and color of a product can be considered as data as well. Any thing that is raw and could be useful to form an information can be represent as data.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card mt-3 mb-3">

              <h4>2. What is information?</h4>
              <p class="lead">Information is the meaningful collection of data. For example Ravi, Indore, 30 just represent the name of a person, place and ege of a person respectively. And this is just the data. But we can form an information with these raw facts that a person with name Ravi lives in Indore city and whose age is 30 years.</p>
              <p class="lead">And this called as information. So whatever data we store must be able to form an information which provide some means. And you can also say that data itself is not the information and information without data can not exist.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>3. What is database?</h4>
              <p class="lead">Database is the collection of data that contains information relevant to an enterprise or business. Without database you can not assume a business to be exist. For example let's consider an example of social media application. A social media app always store the data about users, their posts, comments, files and so on. And you must create format to store this data into application.</p>
              <p class="lead">There could be different types of databases like SQL databases or relational databases where the data stored in tabular format(rows and columns) and the other type of database is NoSQL database where the information can be stored as documents. Both has some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
              <p class="lead">And selection of the database will totally depends on your choice. However it is also possible to start with any of the databse types and can be changed over the time as well.</p>

              <h4>4. What is a record in database?</h4>
              <p class="lead">A record is a collection of the data in a table or document.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card mt-3 mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>5. What is database instance and database schema?</h4>
              <p class="lead">All Databases change over the time as the information is inserted and deleted and updated. The collection of information stored in the database at a particular moment is called an instance of the database. The overall design of the database is called the database schema.</p>
              <p class="lead">For example if you have an application with 5 tables in database then these 5 tables will form the schema of your application and the number of records in each table will denotes the instance of the schema.</p>
              <p class="lead">A database instance may change frequently but the schema is something that change infrequently. However the changes in the databse schema also depends on the current state of your application. If your application is in initial development phase then changes into schema might be frequent but if your application is rich featured enabled and lot of development work has been done than it's schema may change infrequently.</p>

              <h4>6. What is a relation?</h4>
              <p class="lead">A relation is usually is table which contains the data in the form of rows and columns. Every column has a type associated with it. Each row in a relation represents a record or tuple. A relation can be connected to other relations as well.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="card mt-3 mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>7. What is entity and entity set?</h4>
              <p class="lead">An Entity is a real world object that is distinguishable from all other objects. For example if you have a user table in your application then every user is distinguishable from all other users. Every entity has a set of properties that we called as attributes.</p>
              <p class="lead">For example a user can have name, email, address, contact attributes and these are also know as user's properties as well. We store these properties as data in the database. An entity is referred to a record or row in a relation.</p>
              <p class="lead">An Entity Set is the set or collection of entites of same type. An entity set is refererred to a relation.</p>
              <p class="lead">In Object Relation Mapping an entity set is referred to a class and entity referred to an object of that class.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>8. What is primary key?</h4>
              <p class="lead">A primary key is a unique identifier for a record. It is a key in a relation that is unique for each record. A relation can have only one primary key in it but choices to decide a primary key can be multiple.</p>
              <p class="lead">A primary key can be a single attribute or combination of multiple attributes. A primary key always satisfies the NOT NULL and UNIQUE KEY constraint.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card mt-3 mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>9. What is foreign key?</h4>
              <p class="lead">A foreign key is an attribute in one relation which points to the primary key of the other relation.</p>
              <p class="lead">A relation having foreign key is known as the child relation and the table with primary key pointed by a foreign key is known as the referenced relation or parent relation.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card mt-3 mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>10. What is unique key constraint?</h4>
              <p class="lead">A unique key means that no two rows in a relation or table can have the exact values for all listed attributes. A unique key can be a primary key, candidate key. With the unique key constraint you can ensure that every row in the table is unique. There might be some attributes with the same values but no two rows can be entirly same.</p>
              <p class="lead">When you relation has the primary key exist then it's okay if you don't define any other unique key constraint. However you can define as many you need.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card mt-3 mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h4>11. What is not null key constraint?</h4>
              <p class="lead">NULL means the unknown value. However it's a valid value for any kind of database attributes. And you can store this for any type, I mean strings, integers and so on.</p>
              <p class="lead">The NOT NULL constraint prohibits the insertion of unknown data. When this constraint presents you must provide a valid value for specific attribute which make sense while forming the information.</p>
              <p class="lead">For example consider that you have a user table in your schema and if you provide a null value for a user name and then when you access that user record, means you are trying to access unknown user so to avoid this case you can set NOT NULL constraint to user name and every time a user is inserted into database you will get an error if the name for that user record is not present or null.</p>
              <p class="lead">There are many situations where we want to avoid null values. For example primary keys and foreign keys. Primary key must be present to uniquely identify a record in a relation and foreign key must be present to identify the relationship.</p>
